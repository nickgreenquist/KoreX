1. After the Arduino is hooked up properly with FSR sensors, open the Arduino code
2. Run Arduino code and ensure there are no errors
3. Open Processing code
4. Run Processing code as the Arduino code is running (DO NOT have the arduino explorer open)
5. Apply pressure to sensors to see the pressure map respond. Adjust max readings as needed or swap inputs if sensors are not reading correctly.
